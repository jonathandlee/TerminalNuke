# TerminalNuke

## Overview
TerminalNuke is a small addition to Lethal company that makes use of [NotAtomicBomb's Amazing TerminalAPI](https://github.com/NotAtomicBomb/TerminalApi) to allow users to drop bombs on users from the terminal. These bombs work by detonating on impact at the location of a designated player, exploding 2 seconds after launch and killing all entities within a certain radius. 

## Commands
### Players
The players command allows you to see a list of all playernicknames for use in the kill command. The list of players is generated upon each terminal interaction, so as to maintain an updated list of players (in case someone leaves).
### Kill
To kill a player, type `kill playername` into the terminal. Note that this command is not documented in the terminal's `help` command; this is intentional to keep players in the dark, if they so desire.
